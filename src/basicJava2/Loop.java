    //What is loop?-

    //Looping in programming languages is a feature which allows to execute a set of instruction/function
    //while some condition evaluates to true.

    //Benefit of loop-

    //Loops can execute a block of code as long as a specified condition is reached.
    //Loops are handy because they save time, reduce errors, and they make code more readable.


    //loop is mainly 3 type

    //for loop -
    //while loop
    //do..while loop
    //---
    // for each loop is also there but not in the main loop types

    //When to use which loop? and their use cases:

    // Generally a for loop is used to iterate over an array. Use a for loop when you know the loop should execute n times.
    // A while loop is used for reading a file into a variable. Use a while loop when asking for user input.
