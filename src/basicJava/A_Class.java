	//What is A class?

	//Class is a blueprint to create objects.

	//A class can mainly have public , abstract or final access modifier.
	//Top Level class can not be private or Protected because -



	//IF A TOP LEVEL CLASS IS PRIVATE :-
	//it can not be able to interact with real time objects.
	//it will be completely useless.
	//ONLY INNER OR NESTED CLASS CAN BE PRIVATE NOT THE TOP LEVEL CLASS.

	//IF A CLASS IS Protected :-
	//As of the meaning of protected, a top level class cannot be protected because then it will not have access to
	// the real time objects as well.
	//Inner classes or nested classes can be protected but not the top level class.

	// What is Wrapper class in java?
	// Wrapper classes provide a way to use primitive data types (int, boolean, etc..) as objects.
	// Sometimes you must use wrapper classes, for example when working with Collection objects,
	// such as ArrayList, where primitive types cannot be used
