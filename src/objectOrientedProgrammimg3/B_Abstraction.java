    //Abstract class:
    //If a class has at least one abstract method, then the class must be declared abstract.
    //If a class is declared abstract, it cannot be instantiated.
    //To use an abstract class, you have to inherit it from another class, provide implementations to the abstract methods in it.
    //If you inherit an abstract class, you have to provide implementations to all the abstract methods in it.

    //Abstract method: can only be used in an abstract class, and it does not have a body.
