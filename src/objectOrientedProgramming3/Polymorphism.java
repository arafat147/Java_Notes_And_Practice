public class Polymorphism {

    //**Polymorphism means "many forms", and it occurs when we have many classes that are related to each other by inheritance.

    // Like we specified in the previous chapter; Inheritance lets us inherit attributes and methods from another class.
    // Polymorphism uses those methods to perform different tasks. This allows us to perform a single action in different ways.

    // Why And When To Use "Inheritance" and "Polymorphism"?
    // It is useful for code re usability: reuse attributes and methods of an existing class when you create a new class.

    // Polymorphism in Java has two types:
    // Compile time polymorphism (static binding) and Runtime polymorphism (dynamic binding).
    // Method overloading is an example of static polymorphism, while method overriding is an example of
    // dynamic polymorphism.
